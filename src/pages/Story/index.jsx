        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          In September 2019, we first stumbled into each other’s lives at
          Burning Seed – a creative, collaborative, community-based festival in
          the Matong State Forest in New South Wales.
        </p>
        <p>
          We instantly bonded over our shared love of psytrance, festivals,
          fried rice… and Excel spreadsheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a week, our relationship became official. Our adventures took
          us on dozens of road trips, a romantic week in Vanuatu, and a magical
          long weekend at Esoteric Festival.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, in March 2020, the world locked down. We took the
          opportunity to move in together to a beautiful new neighbourhood -
          because what could go wrong with spending 24/7 in the same house?
        </p>
        <p>
          As it turns out, it was fantastic. From daily neighbourhood walks, to
          visiting each other’s home offices, to creating the best fusion
          Asian/European recipes - we enjoyed every minute of our lockdown
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much so, that once the final lockdown ended in November 2021, we
          drove up to Bright and got engaged at the top of Mount Buffalo - and
          it was happily ever after!
        </p>
        <p>
          On Christmas Day, we purchased our forever home - and after many
          months of planning, moving and renovations, we can’t wait for you to
          see it on our special day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our dream wedding will bring together our favourite people from every
          facet of our lives - we’ve either danced, camped, worked, studied or
          lived together, and we’d love to have you there!
